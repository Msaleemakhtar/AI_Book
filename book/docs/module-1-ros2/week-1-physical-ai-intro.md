# Week 1: Physical AI Introduction

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what Physical AI means and why it matters
- Differentiate between digital AI and embodied intelligence
- Identify key components of humanoid robotics systems
- Explore real-world applications of Physical AI

## Introduction

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with the physical world through embodied agents like humanoid robots. Unlike traditional digital AI that processes data in virtual environments, Physical AI systems must perceive, reason about, and interact with the real world in real-time.

Humanoid robots present unique challenges: they must balance on two legs, manipulate objects with dexterous hands, navigate complex environments, and interact naturally with humans. This week introduces the core concepts of Physical AI and establishes the foundation for our 13-week journey into humanoid robotics control.

## Key Concepts

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI combines computer vision, natural language processing, motion planning, and control theory to create intelligent machines that can operate autonomously in human environments. This field sits at the intersection of robotics, AI, and embodied cognition.

### Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid form factors allow robots to navigate spaces designed for humans, use human tools, and interact intuitively with people. Companies like Tesla (Optimus), Figure AI (Figure 01), and Boston Dynamics (Atlas) are racing to deploy humanoid robots in factories, warehouses, and homes.

## Next Steps

In Week 2, we'll explore sensors and actuators - the eyes, ears, and muscles of humanoid robots.
